          Step 1: Download the project. If you have not trained a text model that can detect good and bad phrases, <a class="hover-underline" href="https://cognimate.me:2635/home" target="_blank">train a new model</a>.
                  Use the categories "good" and "bad". Put phrases like "You're a good boy" in the good category and "You're a bad boy" in the bad category.
      - step: >
          Step 2: After training your model, write down your API key and the model name to use in the starter project you downloaded.

#           Step 1: Start by loading our starter project for Smart lights. You can download it <a class="hover-underline" href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1WfdCzakpQPz4jnaPt8jY47w6kNkEVVJx"> here</a>.

#       - step: >
#           Step 2: Right now, the lights are only reacting to specific phrases. How can we make it react to the mood of our response? Let's load the <a class="hover-underline" href="/cognimates-website/extensions/feelings">Feelings extension</a>.

#       - step: >
#           Step 4: In order for our lights to know when to start analyzing our speech, we need to broadcast that we are done listening. So let's use a broadcast block and have the message be received by another block.
#                   <img src = "https://imgur.com/WyCtYos.png"/ class="wide-photo">
#       - step: >
#           Step 5: Now instead of having the light colors change according to exactly what we're saying, we can have them change depending on if we're feeling positive (good), negative (bad), or neutral (somewhere in between).

    Connect a Lego Wedo and Muse EEG headset to control objects in water with your mind. <br><br> This project was part of the curriculum at the <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-hong-kong-steam-camp-blending-mind-and-hand-1003">2018 CIS STEAM Camp in Hong Kong</a>.
    The team helped develop a module using Cognimates and provided <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bHOL6Jhf9RwSZqOOVRFK5qg72nVj3NUEzaI3D6-1wAQ/edit?usp=sharing">master teacher guide</a> in addition to training for camp leaders. The two day module included <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S7cMnVH-vhRZ4iyIg_9-foSmFPoN527cjyBXCfQcCNc/edit?usp=sharing">day one slides</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KjHqq3dtVqoPDoQUql3dxv9OOwvEOg0lVH0J55Zau7M/edit?usp=sharing">day two slides</a>. <br>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-bDoTu33Q5Z5qRUD6cPk54TI3jRI9msg">Here</a> is the analysis and feedback from the educators involved in the camp.

          Step 1: Load the simple version of Waterkinesis <a class="hover-underline" href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10dW5_AwEZbP8f0d7BTz9eoI_ZFJ8SopG">here</a>. This is missing a few blocks that you will add yourself following this guide. If you want the full project, use the large, pink download button at the top of this page. 
          This project uses the Muse extension, which you can use with the <a href="https://choosemuse.com/">Muse headband</a> to record your brain EEG values, and the Lego Wedo extension, which lets you program with a <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/elementary/intro/wedo2">Lego Wedo</a>.
                  <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/I3f95wJ.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 2: Please read the instructions <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fdgfuKUJvPfwSfwBVwO8hrNdHXOlou3Sq4eXLvi7uNQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> before you start this step, and read through the debugging tips as well. Now, connect the Lego Wedo using the Scratch Device Manager, and load the Lego Wedo extension on Cognimates. 
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/13OyNAN.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 3: Load the muse extension to connect to your Muse headset. Follow the notifications and pair your device with the Muse headset.
                  <img src= "https://imgur.com/hFEZ4eT.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 4: Once your headset is connected, watch the Lego Wedo change light colors based on your EEG values! The current threshold values are set to 100, but the best thresholds for you might be different. Click the “Get value of” blocks to see your EEG values and figure out what your thresholds should be.

      - step: >
          Step 5: Try adding movement blocks! Make the Wedo move forward and change directions depending on the side of your body that moved. </br>
                  <img src= "https://imgur.com/gKFIHpi.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 6: You can choose to move the Wedo on land, or try a water-based activity with this code! We recommend you place the Lego Wedo smarthub and motor in a waterproof box, drill a hole to the side of the box, and use a lego stick piece to connect a plastic propeller to the wedo motor. Test out other mechanical designs that you think will also work!
