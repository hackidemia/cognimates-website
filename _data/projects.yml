        photo: /images/projects/rock/rock-1.png
      - step: >
          Step 2: This project uses the <a href="/cognimates-website/extensions/vision">Vision extension</a>, which is a model you can train to recognize images. 
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/wxe3rOF.png"/ class="wide-photo">    
      - step: >
          Step 3: Click the green flag and hold your hand up to the webcam to play rock, paper, scissors with your computer! Your computer will attempt to recognize what move you played and compare it to a move that the computer randomly chose.
                  <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/wlpxZKH.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 4: Sometimes our computer doesn't recognize what our move is. 
                  <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/8gvcIRA.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 5: We can fix this problem by adding the new example that we just took with our webcam and adding it to the classifier and retrain our model! Let's start by adding broadcast blocks at the end of our scoring blocks in the "you" sprite.
                  <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/F3BZayo.png"/ class="wide-photo">   
      - step: >
          Step 6: Next we need a "When I receive training" block in the "computer" sprite so that we can begin training at the end of every round.       
                  <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/EkKpfDL.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 7: Let's use another events block that will trigger everytime we press the "t" key. Let's have the computer ask us what move we actually played.
                  <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/7dtGVYE.png"/ class="wide-photo">     
      - step: >
          Step 8: Using another block from the Vision extension, we can add our webcam photo to the category we just entered in our model.
                  <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/DFhF55y.png"/ class="wide-photo">   
      - step: >
          Step 9: Now we can send our own example back to the model to retrain and hopefully improve it!

    - step: >
        Step 2: To make this more interesting, we can use the <a href="/cognimates-website/extensions/twitter">Twitter</a> to get the last tweet from someone. Then use a block from the <a href="/cognimates-website/extensions/feelings">Feelings extension</a> to check on the mood of the Tweet. <br>
                  <img src="https://imgur.com/UbWZMPk.png"/ class="wide-photo">

        Step 3: We can combine both the Twitter and the Feelings extensions so that we get the mood of a tweet.
                  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0BPBzX0.png"/ class="wide-photo">
    - step: >
        Step 4: Now that we can get the mood of the tweet, we can change the costume of the emoji to make it happy or sad, make the emoji move up or down for the mood. We can also move the emoji to show the mood.<br>
                  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Azt5FJS.png"/ class="wide-photo">
    - step: >
        Step 5: Finally, you can add in some blocks from the music extension to play some happy, sad, or neutral notes depending on the mood we received from the tweet. <br>

    guide: 
      - step: >
          Step 1: Start by loading our starter project for Good Boy. You can download it <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yXY-ZFlqYsNufdCsGADG-waHfFGi_wIn"> here</a>.
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/r6Np1Mg.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 2: Click on the green flag and see what happens when you say, "Good boy!" Or, how about when you say, "Bad boy!" How does the puppy react?
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/DoIKc5T.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 3: What if we wanted to say other things besides "Good boy" or "Bad boy"? Using our Text extension, we can use a text classifier to recognize whether your message is good or bad. Start by loading the <a href="/cognimates-website/extensions/text">Text extension</a>.
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/zZJappa.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 4: Using one of the blocks from the Text extension we can recognize whether or not our speech is good or bad. Can you guess which one that might be?<br>
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/tKk2zdU.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 5: In order for our puppy to know when to start recognizing our speech, we need to first set the id of the classifier (recognizer) that we will use. Then, we can have our puppy tell us whether he recognizes your message as good or bad, by using a Say block from Looks.
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/kygZA8U.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 6: Instead of having the puppy reacting to what it hears, we can now have him react to what kind of message he recognizes. For that we can use the "When text is" block for when the message is good, or for when it is bad. 
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/CuCdyQ7.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 7: Let's try one more thing. How about having our puppy also react to backhanded compliments? Luckily, our model can differentiate between good, bad, and backhanded comments.<br>

          Step 1: Start by loading our starter project for Smart lights. You can download it <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1WfdCzakpQPz4jnaPt8jY47w6kNkEVVJx"> here</a>.

      - step: >
          Step 2: Right now, the lights are only reacting to specific phrases. How can we make it react to the mood of our response? Let's load the <a href="/cognimates-website/extensions/feelings">Feelings extension</a>. 
        photo: images/projects/make-me-happy/make-me-happy-3.png 
      - step: >
          Step 3: With the Feelings extension we can get the mood or feeling our speech. 
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/zCwbCN7.png"/ class="wide-photo"> 
      - step: >
          Step 4: In order for our lights to know when to start analyzing our speech, we need to broadcast that we are done listening. So let's use a broadcast block and have the message be received by another block. 
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/WyCtYos.png"/ class="wide-photo">
      - step: >
          Step 5: Now instead of having the light colors change according to exactly what we're saying, we can have them change depending on if we're feeling positive (good), negative (bad), or neutral (somewhere in between).

                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/lT0eCC4.png"/ class="wide-photo"> 
      - step: >
          Step 3: Click on the green flag. Violet's going to start off with a pink tummy and ask to get her color changed. She’ll be impatient at first - see if you can fix it by putting a red object in front of the camera!
                  <img src = "https://imgur.com/FeCVftO.png"/ class="wide-photo"><br>
      - step: >
          Step 4: Yay, Violet's tummy color changed! If you click on Violet's costumes, you can see what other tummy colors are available. Adjust the code so that Violet's tummy changes with any of the given colors. Now, we can track for more than just red and have even more variety!

      - step: >
          Step 5: Try adding your own colors that the camera could track. Remember that once you add a color, it’ll track colors that are within the same color range - for example, light green, medium green, and dark green might all be tracked if you set medium green to be the tracked color. Go for the classic rainbow colors - give Violet new costumes so that she can be pretty in all different colors!

          Step 6: You can choose to move the Wedo on land, or try a water-based activity with this code! We recommend you place the Lego Wedo smarthub and motor in a waterproof box, drill a hole to the side of the box, and use a lego stick piece to connect a plastic propeller to the wedo motor. Test out other mechanical designs that you think will also work!
