  short_intro: >
    Try programming Alexa!
  description: >
    Currently the Alexa Scratch skill is integrated with the Alexa Scratch extension we built for Scratch 3.0 which can be run from any mobile device or computer. Currently the Alexa Extension allows users to&#58;
    <ul>
      <li>teach it answers to questions</li>
      <li>share with it their preferences (favorite color, movie etc)</li>
      <li>leave messages</li>
      <li>execute specific blocks on scratch</li>
      <li>communicate with other extensions like Jibo, Wemo plug, Spotify, etc</li>
    </ul>
    You can learn more about this extension and how it came to be <a class="hover-underline" href="https://devpost.com/software/alexa-scratch-skill-jbt6h7" target='_blank'>here</a>.
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    Enable the Personal Chatbot skill on Alexa! One option is to tell Alexa "Enable Personal Chatbox skill". Otherwise, you can open open your Alexa app or go to the Amazon website.<br>
        To enable Alexa skills&#58;<br>
        <ol>
        <li>If you are using the app, go to the menu and select Skills. If you want to use the Amazon Store, find Personal Chatbax <a class="hover-underline" href=https://tinyurl.com/ydc5zsxn target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
        <li>If you are using the app, open the skill detail page and select the Enable Skill option, or ask Alexa to open the skill. If you are on the Amazon Store, click the enable button on the right hand side of the page.</li>
        </ol>
      <h3>Connecting to Personal Chatbot from Scratch 3.0</h3>
      To use this extension, you will need the following blocks inside your script somewhere, in this order.<br><br>
      <a class="hover-underline" href="https://imgur.com/kJRXZSb"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kJRXZSb.png" title="source is imgur.com" height="180"/></a><br><br>
      The first extension block creates a user account with Personal Chatbot. The next one logs you into that account on your computer! The last block gives you an access code to connect to Alexa properly.<br><br>
      Tell Alexa "Open Personal Chatbot". Alexa will ask you to say "connect followed by your access code". Tell Alexa "Connect [your access code]", and begin programming with Alexa!

                  This extension will only work on Chrome's "incognito mode". Phillips Hue Lights can only be connected through an http URL, and most browsers only use https for security reasions. Follow these instructions to use your Phillips Hue Lights&#58;
                  <ol>
                    <li> First, open a new icognito window. <br><br>

                    If your browser looks like the image above, then you have opened codelab in http successfully! Note that you cannot use your camera or microphone on the http version of the codelab. This is a rule set by Google Chrome for security reasons.</li>
                    <br><br><li>If you are using this extension for the first time with your Phillips Hue Lights, you need to connect to your bridge. Make sure you are on the same wifi network as the Phillips Bridge. Then, open the Extensions Library. Before loading the Smart Lights extension, click the center of your Phillips bridge.<br><br>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zrtno6ym.jpg" title="source - imgur.com" /><br><br> After clicking the Hue Bridge, click on the Smart Lights Extension. This is the only time you have to run this step. The extension will connect and load automatically from now on.</li>

                  </ol>
      - step: You will also have to download and run this server file to connect to your Wemo Switch&#58; <a class="hover-underline" href="https://gist.github.com/satvu/97c143a62ef4df71be7dbadb032b68cb">wemoSwitch.js</a> You can run this file using the command "node wemoSwitch.js".

      - step: After running the above command, if you see the following text&#58; <i>Server running on localhost&#58;3000</i> followed by <i>Wemo Device Found</i>, then congrats! You have set up wemo correctly and can now use it with Cognnimates.
