        Much of our daily life is quietly being reshaped by AI, with 47 million people already using Alexa in their homes in the USA only and an entire generation of children growing up with this technology. I believe the best way to understand how AI works is by doing. In this talk, I will show how children (7-14 years old) from all over the world are currently reading, writing and tinkering with AI using Cognimates, the open source platform for AI education that I created at MIT Media Lab. I will invite you to imagine how we can change the future of learning and creating with AI and democratize the access to machine learning and data science education.

            If toys start speaking back: what role do we want artificial intelligence (AI) to play in our families and the education of our children? During the AI AI Barbie hackathon and evening programme we will look with experts at the role of AI in the relationship between parents and children.
